# all-in-one-university-app
All in one app where we can have complete smart services for university related to cleanliness, lost &amp; found, canteen orders, event notifications, etc. You think standing in the queue for ordering food and then waiting for the food to get ready is wasting time? Yeah me too. How if we could just order the food after (after the lectures/before reaching the canteen) itself and the food gets ready before you get there. So, you’ve found an earphone and not sure where you’re supposed to report it? Have an issue? Report it via app. Found dirt in your classroom and don’t know the appropriate authority to report? Could we just directly report this in the app and the appropriate authority will take care of the situation.
